# Agent Modes

Modes define clear boundaries — no skipping ahead, no mixing phases.

```
🔍 Research → 📋 Plan → ⚡ Execute → ✅ Complete
```

## 🏁 Start

```
/moderails
```

The protocol initialisation. 

The agent asks you to describe what you want to build before exploring your codebase.

## 🔍 Research

```
#research
```

The agent explores your codebase, searches for relevant context, and asks clarifying questions to fully understand the requirements.

**No code changes allowed** — understanding first, implementation later.

## 💡 Brainstorm (optional)

```
#brainstorm
```

Optional. Use if you want to explore alternative approaches to what was agreed in Research. The agent proposes up to 3 options with pros and cons.

## 📋 Plan

```
#plan
```

The agent breaks down the work into atomic TODO items in the task file. Review and approve before moving to execution.

## ⚡ Execute

```
#execute
```

Implement TODO items one by one. Mark each item complete `[x]` in the task file.

> Type `--no-confirmation` to work through all TODOs without stopping for confirmation between items.

**Adjusting the plan:** No plan is perfect. You can adjust the approach along the way — add items, modify steps, or change direction. All changes are recorded in the task file, which remains the single source of truth throughout execution.

## ✅ Complete

```
#complete
```

Mark task as completed, commit changes with conventional commit message. Git hash is stored locally for diff retrieval. 

## ❌ Abort (optional)

```
#abort
```

Abandon task at any point. Permanently deletes the task and resets all git changes.
